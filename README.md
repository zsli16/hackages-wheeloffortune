## About Hackages - Wheel of Fortune

Hackages Wheel of Fortune is a project created at one of Hackage's Hack Days. It is a fun way for participants at the Hackjams to sign up for a raffle for prizes that are given away at each workshop. 

It features a simple sign-up form that validates names with a certain length and email addresses, and a wheel that picks a random number when spun, which represents the index of a participant in a list.

This project was created with [React](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) and uses a simple Node.js (Express) server in the backend.

## Next Steps

As a proof of conept, the wheel works best with 6-8 names but needs to be adjusted for more use cases. We also use a static JSON file as a mock database for now.

## Getting Started

First clone this repo and run `npm install`.

## Available Scripts

To start the project, you can run:

### `node index.js`

Runs the server in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3001](http://localhost:3001) to view it in the browser.

### `npm start`

Runs the client in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

Then sign up some users and click the Hackages logo in the middle to spin the wheel!
